**Numan** is a cross-platform package manager for [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/). It installs plugins, modules, scripts, and completions from signed registries, pins immutable artifacts in a lockfile, and activates them with Nu only when you ask — keeping installs inert until you run `numan activate`.

Built in Rust for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## About

Nushell’s ecosystem has grown around community packages, but managing them across machines, Nu versions, and platforms is still painful. **nupm** covers local installs well; registry-based workflows need verified artifacts, reproducible lockfiles, and safe activation that survives Nu upgrades.

Numan fills that gap:

| Concern | How Numan handles it |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Trust** | Ed25519 signatures over registry indexes; SHA256 verification of plugin binaries |
| **Reproducibility** | Lockfile v2 pins version, payload hash, and install origin |
| **Platform safety** | Artifacts resolved for the compile-time OS/arch/libc triple |
| **Nu version matching** | Resolver respects per-package Nu constraints |
| **Activation isolation** | `install` never touches Nu; only `activate` registers plugins or writes autoloads |
| **Crash recovery** | Journals for activation, autoload, lifecycle, and nupm import operations |
| **nupm coexistence** | Read-only discovery, one-way import, and drift detection for existing nupm installs |

Numan is **early-stage** (v0.1.2). Core install, activate, update, remove, gc, registry, doctor, nupm interoperability, and shell completions are implemented and covered by 325+ tests plus real-Nu acceptance on CI. Source builds and lockfile rollback snapshots remain planned; pre-built release binaries are published via GitHub Releases.

## Features

- **Registry-backed installs** — search, inspect versions, and install `owner/name` or `owner/name@version`
- **Package types** — plugins, modules, scripts, completions
- **Verified artifacts** — mandatory SHA256 for plugin binaries; signed registry indexes
- **Scoped activation** — plugins active only when Nu executable hash, Nu version, and plugin registry path match
- **Module autoloads** — managed vendor autoload files with ownership markers and candidate validation
- **Lifecycle management** — `update`, `remove`, and `gc` with pending-lifecycle journal recovery
- **nupm interoperability** — `numan nupm status|inspect|import|diff` for migration from [nupm](https://github.com/nushell/nupm)
- **Health checks** — `numan doctor [--fix]` diagnoses root state and applies safe repairs
- **Shell completions** — bash, fish, zsh, PowerShell via `numan completions`

---

## Installation

### From source

Requires [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable) and a Nushell binary on `PATH` for activation commands.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tonythethompson/numan.git
cd numan
cargo install --path .
```

The binary is named `numan`.

### Pre-built releases

Download the latest archive for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/tonythethompson/numan/releases). Each release ships:

| Platform | Archive | Binary |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Linux (x86_64) | `numan-<version>-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` | `numan` |
| Windows (x86_64) | `numan-<version>-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip` | `numan.exe` |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `numan-<version>-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` | `numan` |
| macOS (Intel) | `numan-<version>-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` | `numan` |

**Linux / macOS**

```bash
tar -xzf numan-<version>-<target>.tar.gz
install -m 755 numan-<version>-<target>/numan ~/.local/bin/numan
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
Expand-Archive numan-<version>-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip -DestinationPath .
# Add the extracted folder to your PATH, or copy numan.exe into a directory already on PATH
```

Verify downloads with the `SHA256SUMS` file attached to each release.

### crates.io

```bash
cargo install numan-cli
```

Requires [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable). The installed binary is named `numan`.

**Requirements:** a [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/) binary on `PATH` for `numan init`, `numan activate`, and related commands.

### Shell completions

```bash
# Bash
numan completions bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/numan

# Zsh
numan completions zsh > ~/.zfunc/_numan

# Fish
numan completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/numan.fish

# PowerShell (append to $PROFILE)
numan completions powershell | Out-File -Encoding utf8 $PROFILE
```

---

## Quick start

Copy-paste path from install through first activation (replace registry URL and key with your source):

```bash
# Install (pick one)
cargo install numan-cli
# or: download a release archive from GitHub Releases and add numan to PATH

numan init
numan registry add official https://example.com/index.json --key <base64-public-key>
numan registry sync
numan search hooks
numan install owner/package-name
numan activate
numan doctor
```

Install is **inert** — nothing is registered with Nu until you run `numan activate`.

After Nu upgrades, refresh cached paths and activation identity:

```bash
numan init --refresh
```

Optional: install shell completions (`numan completions bash`, etc.) — see [Installation](#installation).

### Step-by-step

#### 1. Initialize

Probe your local Nu installation and create Numan state under the default root (or `--root`):

```bash
numan init
```

`numan init` prints a numbered checklist when no registry is configured yet.

#### 2. Configure a registry

```bash
numan registry add official https://example.com/index.json --key <base64-public-key>
numan registry sync
```

#### 3. Search and install

```bash
numan search hooks
numan info owner/package-name
numan install owner/package-name
numan list
```

#### 4. Activate with Nu

```bash
numan activate                    # activate all inactive packages
numan activate owner/package-name # activate specific packages
numan activate --list             # show activation status
numan activate --check            # verify activation integrity (read-only)
```

For modules:

```bash
numan deactivate owner/module-name
```

#### 5. Maintain installs

```bash
numan update --check              # see available upgrades
numan update                      # apply upgrades
numan remove owner/package-name
numan gc --dry-run                # preview orphaned payload dirs
numan gc                          # delete unreferenced payloads
```

#### 6. Verify health

```bash
numan doctor                      # report-only diagnosis
numan doctor --fix --yes          # apply safe automated repairs
```

## Data layout

By default, Numan stores state under a platform-specific root (override with `NUMAN_ROOT` or `--root`):

| Platform | Default root |
|----------|--------------|
| Linux | `~/.local/share/numan` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/numan` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\numan` |

Important paths under the root:

```text
numan/
├── config.toml          # registries, defaults
├── lockfile             # pinned installs (authoritative)
├── packages/            # immutable versioned payloads
├── registries/          # synced index caches
├── state/               # journals, nupm import provenance
└── nu_state/            # cached Nu paths for activation checks
```

Payload paths are immutable: `packages/<type>/<owner>/<name>/<version>-<hash>/`.

## nupm migration

Numan can discover and import compatible packages from an existing [nupm](https://github.com/nushell/nupm) installation without modifying nupm state.

```bash
# Point at nupm home (or rely on $NUPM_HOME)
numan nupm status --nupm-home ~/.config/nupm
numan nupm inspect --all --nupm-home ~/.config/nupm

# Import a supported module package
numan nupm import /path/to/package --as myorg/my-module --yes

# Check drift after the source changes
numan nupm diff myorg/my-module
```

**Compatibility matrix:** which nupm package shapes Numan can import is defined in [docs/nupm-compatibility.md](docs/nupm-compatibility.md) (compat-schema-v1). Run `numan nupm inspect` to classify packages before import.

---

## Design principles

1. **Install is inert** — installs write only to `$NUMAN_ROOT`; Nu is never invoked.
2. **Activate is explicit** — the only command that registers plugins or manages autoload files.
3. **Lockfile is ground truth** — derived state (e.g. autoload projections) is not authoritative.
4. **Immutable payloads** — versions are content-addressed; updates leave old dirs until `gc`.
5. **Mutation serialization** — advisory locks prevent concurrent destructive operations.
6. **Safe Nu invocation** — plugin paths are passed via environment variables, not interpolated into shell strings.

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for architecture details aimed at contributors and agents.

## Development

```bash
cargo build
cargo test                    # unit + integration (325+ tests)
cargo clippy -- -D warnings   # lint (CI-enforced)
cargo fmt                     # format

# Real-Nu acceptance tests (requires Nu 0.113+ on PATH)
cargo test -- --ignored
```

CI runs tests, clippy, `rustfmt --check`, and real-Nu acceptance on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS.

### Contributing

1. Branch from `master` (`feature/...` or `fix/...`).
2. Add or update tests for behavior changes.
3. Ensure `cargo test` and `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` pass.
4. Open a pull request with a clear description and test plan.

PR reviewers should follow [`.github/instructions/review.instructions.md`](.github/instructions/review.instructions.md).
