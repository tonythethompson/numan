# Numan PR review instructions

Use this file when reviewing pull requests (human or automated). [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) remains the source for project structure and build commands; this file focuses on **what to flag in review**.

## CI gates (must pass)

- `cargo test` — full suite
- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
- `cargo fmt --check`

## Severity labels

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **P0** | Data loss, security boundary break, silent corruption, or trust bypass |
| **P1** | Incorrect behavior on happy path, missing error handling for common failures |
| **P2** | Test/fixture mismatch with documented contract, misleading docs, maintainability |
| **P3** | Style, naming, non-blocking suggestions |

## Architecture invariants (flag violations)

1. **Install is inert** — `numan install` must not invoke Nu or touch autoload/plugin registration.
2. **Activate is separate** — only activation/deactivation commands modify Nu integration state.
3. **Mutation lock** — all mutating commands (`install`, `remove`, `update`, `gc`, future `nupm import`) must call `acquire_mutation_lock(root)`.
4. **Atomic JSON writes** — lockfile, journals, and state files use `write_json_atomic`; no partial writes.
5. **Journals under `state/`** — pending activation, autoload, lifecycle journals live under `$NUMAN_ROOT/state/`.
6. **Module autoload identity** — four-part match (Nu exe hash, Nu version, vendor autoload dir, managed file path); lockfile `module_activation` is ground truth.
7. **Managed file ownership** — never overwrite foreign autoload files; respect `OWNERSHIP_MARKER`.
8. **Nu invocation safety** — paths via env vars only; no runtime interpolation in Nu program strings.
9. **Test seams** — unit tests use `FakeCandidateRunner` / injectable registrars; do not spawn real `nu` in unit tests.
10. **Phase 6 nupm boundary** — read-only toward `NUPM_HOME`; no `build.nu` execution; no bidirectional sync.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Error paths return `anyhow::Result` with context; library code does not panic.
- [ ] New mutating paths acquire the mutation lock and snapshot lockfile before change.
- [ ] Function parameters use `&Path` not `&PathBuf` (clippy enforced).
- [ ] Tests cover failure modes, not only success.
- [ ] Docs/AGENTS.md updated when structure or conventions change.
- [ ] Scope matches PR description; no unrelated refactors.

## Phase-specific notes

- **Lockfile v2** — preserve `origin`, `revision_id`, `payload_sha256`, and journal recovery semantics on lifecycle changes.
- **nupm compat (Phase 6+)** — follow [`docs/nupm-compatibility.md`](../../docs/nupm-compatibility.md) supported/rejected profiles; fixtures under `tests/fixtures/nupm/` are the contract for parser/classifier tests.
